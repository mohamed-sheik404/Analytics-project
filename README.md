# Analytics-project

 - This is my first public SQL project. I chose to explore airplane wildlife incidents from 1990 to 2015 using MySQL, inspired by Chris French's post on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/airplane-wildlife-incidents-1990-2015-chris-french/).

# Project Objectives
 - My goal with this project was to practice the fundamental SQL skills in data manipulation and filtering.

# About the data
 - At first, the data seemed pretty simple. But, when I started cleaning it up in Excel, things got interesting.
 - I cleared out empty cells, dropped unnecessary columns, and renamed the column names for the SQL part.
 - After doing all that, over 40,000 records were cleared (out of about 110,000), and that is bugging my mind as I feel like I messed up the data integrity.
 - During the analysis, the numbers made sense and I didn't feel as lost compared to when I was cleaning the data. Is it normal to feel this way? I don't know but I hope to learn about data cleaning and integrity.

# Challenge
- Cleaning the data was the biggest challenge as this is my first time cleaning data with this complexion in Excel. I learned a few things on the way and looking forward to implementing into the next messy data.

# Results
- In the year 2009, there were a whopping 3991 wildlife strikes.
- August turned out to be a hotspot month, with a total of 9189 incidents.
- The most frequently encountered species was the "Unknown small bird," accounting for a staggering 20,281 strikes.
- Among operators, Southwest Airlines topped the list with 9531 reported incidents.
- When it comes to aircraft, the Boeing 737-700 took the lead with 4837 recorded strikes.
